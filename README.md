Hermes searches a text file, in this case a fanfiction called Harry Potter and the Prince of Slytherin, to find a quote and a json file & a xlsx file to find data from a dictionary using RegEx. 

# Usage

To use the application, you just need to input your quote and click on the `Search Book` & `Search Dictionary` button to begin the search. If you wanted to know the Dictionary Index, click on `Show Dictionary Index` button.</br></br>
